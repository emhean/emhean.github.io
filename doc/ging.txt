If you ever meet a ginger of this calibar the most important thing to remember: DO NOT TOUCH IT. If it touches you at any point it WILL consume your soul. 
If for any reason you cannot escape touching a Ginger, Listerine is the only known preventative for contracting Gingervitis so remember to carry a small bottle at all times. 

Also, remember to watch out for the long, sharp claws of the Ginger. With such tools they can latch on to you. If so, call the relevant authorities and have it removed. 
If after the meeting you start to feel hatred of small animals and there is a reddish tinge in your hair, you have breathed in "Ginger Spores", and you will in fact become a Ginger in the next 35 hours.
 
The Ginger Spores travel into your heart, where Gingervitis is realised as the disease begins to slowly sucks your soul out, leaving a giant Ginger hole. 
If this happens, please attempt suicide at the next convenient moment. Understand that a ginger will never admit to its disease.
And as always, thanks for reading.
