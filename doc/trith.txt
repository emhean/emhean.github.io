One does not. One either is or is not. Nothing in there would be of interest
to you and the payoff is not worth the effort. Go about your life. You'll
not find any reward here.

I admire your curiosity but it will get you nowhere here.

I already knew from my research that Carathis was a character from Vathek,
who had ties to magic and the occult. Your alias listed on this email
address is a (very) thinly veiled reference to Johannes Trithemius,
sixteenth century occultist and cryptographer. I'm guessing your website
probably has to do with the occult- "sharing secret things", as you said.
Secrecy, including through cryptography in various forms, such as the
angelic languages, is an important part of occult practices. I am not
unfamiliar with occultism.
----------
I interrupt my sabbatical with extreme urgency. It is of dire
consequence that I share with you my recent findings concerning the
demise our trusted messenger. For I have in my possession an encrypted
message which I fear may contain a journal of the last days. I have
studied the cyphers intently and now believe I am on the verge of
determining the proper solutions. Vide et credere. I request that you
review my notes and offer your judgment.

As we have long suspected there are mysterious strangers who seek the
message to benefit their own worldly deeds. The cypher must remain sub
rosa.

Worry not for I have concealed my scripts in a manner no one would
ever suspect. The contents are well protected by that charlatan and
impostor who dared to call himself fons necromanticorum, astrologus,
magus secundus chyromanticus agromanticus pyromanticus in hydra arte
secundus.

You must act with haste for I fear the strangers draw nearer with each
passing day.

Salve sis
